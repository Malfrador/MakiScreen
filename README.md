### Improvements
* Use local video files instead of reading a ffmpeg stream. 
* Massively reduced bandwidth usage and true 1080p support (or even 4K if you really want to) thanks to significantly improved compression.
* Download videos from YouTube and play them.
* Plays back audio using an automatically generated resource pack.
* Video pausing, skipping and resuming
* Improved commands.
