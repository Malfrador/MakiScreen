### Improvements
* Use local video files instead of reading a ffmpeg stream. 
* Massively reduced bandwidth usage and true 1080p support (or even 4K if you really want to) thanks to significantly improved compression.
* Download videos from YouTube and play them.
* Plays back audio using an automatically generated resource pack.
* Video pausing, skipping and resuming
* Improved commands. 

Originally a fork of https://github.com/makinori/MakiScreen, though most of the original code has been reworked. Thanks for the inspiration though!
