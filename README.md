# Features
* Play local mp4 files or download videos from YouTube
* Plays back audio using an automatically generated resource pack.
* Video pausing, skipping and resuming. Audio is sliced into seamless chunks, as Minecraft does not support pausing and resuming audio.
* Massively reduced bandwidth usage and true 1080p support (or even 4K if you really want to) thanks to significantly improved compression.
* Floyd-Steinberg dithering for significantly improved video quality. 
* Improved commands. 

Originally a fork of https://github.com/makinori/MakiScreen, though most of the original code has been reworked. Thanks for the inspiration though!
